# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## My name is JoÃ£o Vitor, I'm 21 years old. I love programming and hope to work with it one day

**JoaoRibeiro2/JoaoRibeiro2** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I love web programming and hope to work on it one day. I am a computer technician graduated from ETEC. There I learned to program using Java, PHP and javascript languages. At the moment I continue studying WEB programming.
